## Getting Started

1. To use the extension run the project locally by cloning the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ebiladou/screen-rec-extension

2. Go to your chrome extensions, turn on developers mode. In load unpacked, select the folder containing the cloned files. 

3. Enable the extension and pin it to your tab. Now you can seamlessly record your screen on your browser and share to your friends. 

NB: The backend is not integrated, so recordings will be saved to your local device.
